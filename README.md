# Deployment Guide: Micro Book Social Platform
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to containerize and deploy the entire microservices application using Docker and Docker Compose.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
1.  **Docker**: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2.  **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
3.  **Brevo API Key**: You need an API key from [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) for the notification service to work.

## Step 1: Create a `Dockerfile` for Each Microservice
For each Java-based service, you need a `Dockerfile` to build its container image. The content for each `Dockerfile` will be the same.
Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the content above in the root directory of each of the following services:
- `api-gateway/`
- `chat-service/`
- `file-service/`
- `identity-service/`
- `notification-service/`
- `post-service/`
- `profile-service/`
---
## Step 2: Configure the `docker-compose.yml` File

The `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates the startup and networking of all services, including the application microservices and their backing databases and message brokers.
Place the following content in the `docker-compose.yml` file in the project's root directory.
**Important:** Before running, find the line `BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key` and replace `your_brevo_api_key` with your actual key.

---

## Step 3: Build and Run the Application

1.  Open a terminal in the root directory of the project (where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located).
2.  Run the following command to build the images for all services and start the containers in the background:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
---

## Step 4: Accessing the Application
Once all containers are up and running, the entire platform is accessible through the API Gateway.

-   **API Gateway URL**: `http://localhost:8888`
